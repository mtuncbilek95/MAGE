### On Linux
Requested dependencies
```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

sudo apt install build-essentials g++ gcc cmake cmake-extra-modules libxi-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev waylandpp-dev libwayland-server0 libwayland-client++1 libuuid1 uuid-dev -y
```

## AFTER VULKAN SDK
Please only use main/master branch because this will be the only branch that will be able to work properly.
